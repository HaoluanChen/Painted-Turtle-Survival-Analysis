# STA490 project: Painted-Turtle-Survival-Analysis 

In this statistical analysis, we aimed to understand the natural survival rate for painted turtles in the
Algonquin Park. Our data was collected using the capture-recapture method, which would cause a high
correlation in observations from the same turtle. To take advantage of this type of data, I used
the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model to estimate the survival rate of individuals in a population and identify 
factors that affected the survival rate using the dataset provided by Prof.Njal Rollinson.
